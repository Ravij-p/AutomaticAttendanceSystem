# 🎯 Automatic Attendance System with Face Recognition


> "Efficient, accurate attendance tracking using state-of-the-art facial recognition technology"

## 📋 Overview
This system automates attendance management using deep learning-based facial recognition. It detects faces in classroom/meeting photos, identifies registered individuals, and marks attendance automatically. Built with PyTorch and leveraging triplet loss training, the system achieves high accuracy even with limited training data.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Real-time face detection** using MTCNN
- **Siamese Network architecture** for robust recognition
- **Triplet loss training** for discriminative embeddings
- **Cosine similarity matching** for identification
- **Unknown face flagging** with confidence thresholds
- **GPU acceleration** for fast processing

## 🏫 Classroom Workflow
1. **Capture group photo** of classroom/meeting
2. **System detects** all faces in the image
3. **Compares each face** against registered embeddings
4. **Generates attendance report** with recognized individuals
5. **Flags unknown faces** for manual verification

## 💻 Usage

### 1. Prepare Dataset
Organize images in directory structure:
```
dataset/
├── face_0/
│   ├── original.jpg
│   ├── aug1.jpg
│   └── ...
├── face_1/
└── ...
```

### 2. Train Model

### 3. Run Recognition
